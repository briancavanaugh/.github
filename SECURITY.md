# Security Policy

## Brand promise

Keeping users safe and secure is a top priority.
We welcome the contribution of external security researchers.

## Scope

If you believe you’ve found a security issue in any software, service, or
website governed by this repository, we encourage you to notify us.

Projects sometimes do unsafe things by design (such as a plugin that
executes arbitrary code or an option that is dangerous).
This unsafe behavior should be explicitly documented and, if it is, is not
considered a security issue.

There are no hard and fast rules to determine if a bug is worth reporting as a
security issue or a “regular” issue.
When in doubt, please do send us a report.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues can be reported by sending an email to security@.com,
which will go to all team members.
The team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours. You will receive a more
detailed response within 96 hours.

We will create a maintainer security advisory on GitHub to discuss internally,
and when needed, invite you to the advisory.

## Preferences

*   Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a clearly
defined impact
*   Submit one vulnerability per report
*   Social engineering (such as phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited
