## Contributions

There’s several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.

### Improve documentation

As a user of this project you’re perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.
Anything!

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, aren’t reproducible, or are just incorrect.
Help make them easier to resolve.

### Give feedback on issues

We’re always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome.
It’s often good to first create an issue to report a bug or suggest a new
feature before creating a pull request to prevent you from doing unnecessary
work.

## Support

See [`support.md`][support] on how to get help.

## Submitting an issue

*   The issue tracker is for issues.
See [`support.md`][support] on how to get help.
*   Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
issue
*   Ensure you’re using the latest version of projects
*   Use a clear and descriptive title
*   Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue,
error message, version, operating system, etcetera
*   The more time you put into an issue, the more we will investigate the issue
*   The best issue report is a failing test proving it

## Submitting a pull request

*   Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent
you from doing unnecessary work
*   For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the
community for feedback as soon as possible
*   New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation
*   Don’t include unrelated changes
*   Lint and test before submitting code
*   Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
it’s your job to convince us
