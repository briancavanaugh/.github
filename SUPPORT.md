### Asking quality questions

Help us help you!

Spending time framing a question and adding support links or resources makes it
much easier to get help.
It’s easy to fall into the trap of asking something too specific when you’re
close to a problem.
Then, those trying to help you out have to spend a lot of time asking additional
questions to understand what you are hoping to achieve.

Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.

*   Try to define what you need help with:
*   Is there something in particular you want to do?
*   What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try
and fix it?
*   Is there a concept you’re not understanding?
*   Learn about the [rubber duck debugging method][rubberduck]
*   Avoid falling for the [XY problem][xy]
*   Search on GitHub to see if a similar question has been asked
*   If possible, provide sample code, a [CodeSandbox][], or a video
*   The more time you put into asking your question, the better help you will receive
